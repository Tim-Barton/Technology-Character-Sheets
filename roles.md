# Roles & Specialisations

Role and Specialisations are effectively Classes and Sub-classes from classic RPGs.

```
E.g.  
Where a Fighter could have a sub-class of Barbarian or Paladin.
A Software Engineer can have a specialisation of Front End or Back End.
```

`This list is by no means complete, and is probably skewed towards the Software Development aspects of Technology.`

## Software Engineer

By mastering the eldritch words of power you can bend reality to your whim. For the betterment of all you create constructs of power to guide, to entertain and to support.

### Front End

Perception *is* reality as far as you're concerned, so you have dedicated yourself to the arts of light and shadow. Mere mortals delight in the simple beauty of what you conjure, or run in fear of the horrors you create.

### Back End

Beneath the view of laymen lies the true world. Streams of information stretching through the ether, guiding and controlling the world around us. Most people go about their lives blissfully unaware while you pursue mastery over these elemental unseen forces.

### Full Stack

A Jack of All Trades, Master of None, you understand that balance must exist in all things. There is no perception without reality, and no reality without perception. So you stand, one foot in each realm, bridging the gap between them with sheer force of will.

## Quality Assurance

When the words of power twist the fabric of reality, demons from the dark realm are drawn to the eddies of power. Bugs, defects or "features" - no matter what you call these demons, you stand between them and the mortal masses.

### Manual Tester

"Traditionalist", the kind will say, "Fool" or "Forgotten" the mean, but none of them understand. No machine can replace a trained human with a probing mind in the hunt for the demons. So you toil in your seemingly unending, thankless calling, keeping us all safe.

### Automation Tester

In the distant past SEs and QAs didn't mix, but now here you are, applying the skills of an SE using the mindset of a QA. You are the unholy now holy, and the saviour of us all.

## Software Operations

It is no use to say the words of power once, for over time their power fades and the constructs fall. Someone needs watch over the constructs, to perform the rituals that feeds power to the words, to ensure that what is built continues for all time. That someone is you.

### Data Centre Operator

Even as so called "powerless" constructs become all the rage, you know that the truth is that their power still comes from somewhere. So you sit, Master of the power flows to all things, maintaining and managing a vast network of constructs

### Site Reliability Engineer

"What if a construct could manage other constructs?" This question opened your eyes to a new world. "What if we could build constructs smaller?" This question drives you every day. "What if we could build constructs that self heal?" This question is the golden dream you hold in your heart as you toil in the darkness.
