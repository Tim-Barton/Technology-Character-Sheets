# Technology Character Sheets

Technology Character Sheets is a fun way to think about your career in Technology in a way a lot of us are probably used to - RPG Character classes and skills.  
These are all styled in the Fantasy Genre, but I am more than happy if someone wants to re-skin this to Sci-Fi or other settings (just be aware of the CC BY-NC-SA licence below)

## How to

1. Start your sheet by searching through the [Roles and Specialisations](roles.md), selecting each that conforms closest to *your current role*

2. Work through the Skill trees, picking the skills that you feel best align with your experience.  
There are two ways you can approach this:  
  * **Points based system** - your history provides you a number of Ability Points that you can 'spend' on skills in the skill tree
  * **Outcomes based system** - (still somewhat TBD) each skill has an outcome you need to met, if you think you meet it, that skill is yours  


3. Once you have completed your Skill Tree, tally up the Attributes scores that each skill provides to generate your Attribute table

Voila you're done!

### Points based system

For each year of experience you have as per the table below, give yourself the points listed.  
Then go through the Skill Tree 'spending' those points on the skills listed.   
It's recommended to think about the path your career has taken, so if you spent 4 years in QA before transitioning to Software Engineering, then spend those QA Points on QA skills.

| | |  
| --- | --- |   
| Each year of self learning | 1 Point |  
| Each year of tertiary education in non Tech fields | 1 Point |   
| Each year of tertiary education in Tech fields | 2 Points |  
| Each year of experience in Tech fields | 3 Points |  
| For every 5 years of experience in Tech Fields | 2 Additional Points |  

```
E.g.
Sam Citizen spent 2 years learning to code in their bedroom during High School.
Then attended College/University for 1 year in Bachelor Arts.
Transitioned and completing a 3 year IT degree.
Sam has now worked for 6 years in the IT field.

Sam's points are:
2 * 1 = 2 (High school self teaching)
1 * 1 = 1 (Bach Arts)
3 * 2 = 6 (Bach IT)
6 * 3 = 18 (6 years experience)
1 * 2 = 2 (6/5 = 1 set of bonus points)
----------------
Total   29

```

### Outcomes based system

```This is the more realistic of the two, but also the hardest to reasonably implement, so will probably be a work in progress.```

Each skill will have an 'Outcome' if you self assess as meeting this outcome then the skill is yours.
